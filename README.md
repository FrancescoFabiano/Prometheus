Do you consider yourself addicted to your smartphone?
Do you have any idea on how much time you spend on it?
Would you be interested in reducing its usage?

... Then Prometheus could ASSIST you!


Prometheusâ€™ true value rests on allowing the user the possibility to reduce smartphones dependency! 
It monitors, tracks the usage of your smartphone and notifies users about specific situations. All notifications, which are easily configurable, depend on the personal set-up directly manageable by users. A more in depth review shows that the app precisely quantifies the time spent on each application, thus clients will have a comprehensive perception of their smarthones usage.

MONITOR
Prometheus monitors the overall usage of appliations during the ordinary use of the smartphone. In other words, it only considers the active use of an individual app. (Protecting your privacy)

TRACK
The time dedicated to each application is tracked by Prometheus, allowing you to review summaries and graphs about your smartphone usage, making it straightforward to obtain a quantification of its usage.

NOTIFY
Prometheus manages four types of 'Intensity of notifications'. In practice, if you exceed the usage time limit programmed for that app or you set it to "always notify", Prometheus notifies the overuse. The intensity levels inform the user on the extent of screen occupied by and the frequency of a notification.

We made available for you a Theme Manager, which allows you to customize colors and avatar used.
